  # 🌍 (Optional but recommended) Localization config
  # This tells Flutter where to find your .arb files and where to generate code.
  # Uncomment if you want to explicitly configure it:
  #
  # generate_localized_resources:
  #   arb-dir: lib/l10n
  #   template-arb-file: app_en.arb
  #   output-localization-file: app_localizations.dart
  #   output-class: AppLocalizations
